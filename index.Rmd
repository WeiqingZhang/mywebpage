I am a postgraduate student in the University of Glasgow's
[Institute of Neuroscience and Psychology](http://www.gla.ac.uk/researchinstitutes/neurosciencepsychology/).
I work with [Prof. Benedict Jones](https://www.gla.ac.uk/researchinstitutes/neurosciencepsychology/staff/benjones).

### Research Interests

I'm interested in the relationship between face width-to-hight ratio and behavioral tendencies, easpecially sexual desire.
